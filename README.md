# Hotel Reception - Guest Request Management

Modern web system for hotel reception staff to efficiently manage guest requests. Built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL.

## Key UX Solutions

**Room-First Design:**

- **Room number prominently displayed** in request cards - the most critical information for reception staff
- Room number shown in large, bold text for quick visual scanning
- Color-coded request status with room number always visible

**Receptionist-Focused Interface:**

- Guest requests sorted by urgency and room number
- One-click status updates (pending ‚Üí in progress ‚Üí done)
- Auto-assignment to appropriate staff by request type
- Quick filters: by room, status, and priority

**Request Card Design:**

- Room number as primary identifier (largest text)
- Guest name and request type as secondary info
- Visual priority indicators for urgent requests
- Estimated completion time for guest communication
